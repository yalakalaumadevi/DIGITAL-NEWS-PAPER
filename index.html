<CENter><h3>BILLIONAIRES</h3></CENter>
</div>
<div class="esther">
        <p>Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires rankings tracks the daily ups and downs of the world’s richest people. The wealth-tracking platform provides ongoing updates on the net worth and ranking of each individual confirmed by Forbes to be a billionaire. The value of individuals’ public holdings are updated every 5 minutes when respective stock markets are open (there will be a 15-minute delay for stock prices). Individuals whose fortunes are significantly tied to private companies will have their net worths updated once a day. In cases where an individual owns a stake in a private company that accounts for 20% or more of his or her net worth, the value of the company will be adjusted according to an industry- or region-specific market index provided by our partners at FactSet Research Systems when available. A rotating cast of the five biggest winners and losers throughout the day is featured at the top of the page, followed by the complete list of billionaires ranked in order of net worth.
     </p></div>
     <p>The Real-Time Billionaire List, an annual compilation by Forbes Magazine, is a renowned roster detailing the wealthiest individuals worldwide, gauged by their estimated net worth. Released each March, this list offers a comprehensive snapshot of the richest man in the world. The first edition of this ranking was introduced in 1987, becoming a widely anticipated and influential annual report on the financial standing of the world’s wealthiest individuals.

        World Richest Man 2024
        A person’s net worth is determined by assessing the value of their reported assets while considering outstanding debts and relevant factors. The rankings indicate the net worth of individuals in terms of US dollars. It is crucial to note that these lists intentionally omit royalties and political leaders whose wealth is primarily linked to their official roles</p>

        <p>The third richest person in the world – Jeff Bezos, aged 59, resides in the United States and holds the position of Founder and Executive Chair at Amazon (AMZN).

            Bezos owned an aerospace company named The Washington Post and Blue Origin, designing rockets and fled to space in July 2021.

                    <p>This week, controversial UK Conservative Member of Parliament Kwasi Kwarteng announced his decision to step down from politics and will not be standing at the next general election which has to take place by January 28, 2025, but could be held this year.

                        Kwarteng, 48, has served as the member of Parliament for Spelthorne, Surrey, since 2010 and has also held senior cabinet positions in government. He is likely to be best remembered for the financial chaos he unleashed during his 38 days as chancellor of the exchequer in 2022.
